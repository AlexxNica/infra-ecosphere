# WEB Service

This package provides Web APIs to control BMC operations. The original purpose is to make a VM where the provisioning service is located to call this application in host OS directly.

## APIs

TBD

## Reference

All the Restful API Web Server implementation idea is from [Making a RESTful JSON API in Go](http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/).

In this package, routes and logger implementation are based on this tutorial.
